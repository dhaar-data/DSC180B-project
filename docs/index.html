                Machine learning is a modern task in data science that uses observed data 
                values to model and predict data. It takes advantage of having observed data 
                available, but what should be done when observed data cannot be obtained? A 
                common practice is to use predicted values when observed values are 
                unavailable, but without any corrections we inevitably run into issues such 
                as deflated standard errors, bias, and inflated false positive rates.
                <br><br>
                Wang et al. proposes a method to correct inference done on predicted 
                outcomes–which they name post-prediction inference, or postpi–in Methods for 
                correcting inference based on outcomes predicted by machine learning. This 
                statistical technique takes advantage of the standard structure for machine 
                learning and uses bootstrapping to correct statistical error using predicted 
                values in place of observed values.
                <br><br>
                We are exploring the applicability of Wang et al.’s postpi bootstrapping 
                technique on political data–that is, on political twitter posts. Our project 
                will be investigating what kinds of phrases or words in a tweet will strongly 
                indicate a person’s political alignment, in the context of US politics. By 
                doing so, we can simultaneously test how the bootstrap post-prediction 
                inference approach interacts with Natural Language Processing models and how 
                this method can be generally applicable towards analyses in political science.
